# Chat client/server

### What is this?

It's a school assignment, where we are tasked with creating
a chat server and client using NODEs net module (TCP)

Server handles all connections from clients, and clients are 
able to talk to each other if same adress is used on connection.

typing .quit in the chat client closes the connection to the server
and disconnects the client.

tested on localhost, iprange 127.0.0.1 - 127.0.0.255



### Usage

To start server, type "node server"

to start client, type "node client"
